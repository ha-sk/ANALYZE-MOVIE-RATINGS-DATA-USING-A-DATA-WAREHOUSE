# ANALYZE-MOVIE-RATINGS-DATA-USING-A-DATA-WAREHOUSE
This project aims to analyze movie ratings using data warehouse. The movieLens small dataset was used, which includes movies with title and genre, ratings, tags and imdb links. A data
warehouse schema was designed and implemented using a galaxy schema. The ETL process was implemented using Python and libraries such as Pandas. The data was later analyzed and
visulized using libraries such as MatplotLib. Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to facilitate data exploration and reporting. The project was successful in providing a new way
to analyze movie ratings.
